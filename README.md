# Image-Classification
This project applies deep learning to classify clothing items from the Fashion-MNIST dataset. I experimented with a fully connected Neural Network (NN) as a baseline and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for improved accuracy, showing the effectiveness of CNNs in computer vision tasks.
